# Part 1 - Introduction to IaC

In this first part, you will learn about Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and how to work with Bicep or Terraform to create a simple resource group and storage account.  You'll also learn about things like:
- running deployments from the command line
- running deployments from GitHub Actions
- building service principals with federated credentials

## Prerequisites

To complete this activity, you must have an editor like VSCode, an Azure Subscription with contributor access, and the Azure CLI installed.

## Part 1: Introduction to IaC with Terraform

Apart from the common concepts of deployment scopes and resource groups there are Terraform specific features that are key to deploying resources. We will explore those in this section:

### Providers

A provider is a plugin that allows Terraform to interact with cloud, SaaS providers and other APIs. Custom terraform providers can be created if needed. Example of providers are: 

- Azure, Google and AWS providers.
- MongoDB, Pager Duty.
- Random, arm2tf.

### Basic file structure

This is the recommended file structure for a working directory:

- **providers.tf:** Specifies the providers used in the deployment as well as any configuration for each of them.
- **main.tf:** Specified the resources being deployed. 
- **variables.tf:** Specifies the variables that will be used to parameterize the deployment.
- **outputs.tf** Specified any values that will be availabe as an output of the deployment.

You can also use the main.tf file to define all the elements mentioned above, however, that will make your deployments harder to read and maintain. 

### Commands

There are 3 main commands that we will explore in this section:

- **terraform init:** Initialized the working directory.
- **terraform plan:** Creates a plan based on the resources specified in your deployment and the resources currenrly deployed. 
- **terraform apply:** Applies the plan generated by the `plan` command.

## Task 1 - Create your first Terraform file to deploy a storage account to an existing resource group

To get started, let's create our first Terraform file. The overall goal for this activity is to create a resource group and a storage account.  We'll do this in two steps.  First, we'll create a resource group, then we'll create a storage account. As we're going, we will create the recommended file structure mentioned above while learning about using variables and outputs, as well as how to create and use additional files as modules.

>**Note:** for this activity, I'm using VSCode with the Terraform extension.  Additionally, I've created a new repository at GitHub which has the starter web application code in it and will be where I'm generating screenshots.  For this reason, if you haven't already, you need a GitHub repository where you can store your code and your Terraform files.

A good way to store this would be similar to the following:

!["Initial repo with folder structure"](images/Part1-terraform/image0001-initialrepo.png)  

### Step 1 - Create your file `main.tf`

For Terraform, we will start by creating a main.tf file.  This can be done in a bash terminal, in VSCode, or in PowerShell. Assuming you can make your way to the correct place and/or make your way to VSCode, create a folder if you don't have one for `iac` and a subfolder `Terraform`. In the terraform subfolder, create a file `main.tf`.

Folder:  

```bash  
iac
```  

FileName:

```bash  
main.tf
```  

VSCode:  

```text  
Right-click on the folder and select New File, name it `main.tf`
```  

>**Note**: For bash and powershell, make sure you make directories `mkdir` and change directories `cd` to the correct location.

Bash:  

```bash  
touch main.tf
```  

PowerShell:  

```PowerShell
"" > "main.tf"
```  

### Completion Check

Before moving on, ensure that you have a file called `main.tf` in a folder called `iac\terraform` at the root of your repository.

!["The file main.tf along with the commands to create in bash"](images/Part1-terraform/image0002-creatingTheTerraformFile.png)  

### Step 2 - Create the terraform code to create a storage account

For this first activity, you'll be creating a simple storage account.  To do this easily, you'll want a couple of extensions for Terraform in place in VSCode:

- Terraform: 
!["The VSCode Terraform Extension is shown"](images/Part1-terraform/image0003-bicepExtension.png)  

- Azure Tools: 
!["The VSCode Azure Tools Extension is shown"](images/Part1-terraform/image0004-azuretools.png)

>**Note:** We may not need Azure Tools, but it's a good idea to have it in place for other things you will do in the future.

First, we need to specify the providers that we will use in the deployment. Add the following code to your main.tf file:

```text 
terraform {
  required_version = ">=1.6.6"

  required_providers {
    azurerm = {
      source  = "hashicorp/azurerm"
      version = "~>3.0"      
    }    
  }
}

provider "azurerm" {
  features {    
  }
}
```

Next, we need to add a `resource` block to create the storage account:

```text 
resource "azurerm_storage_account" "cm_stg_acct" {
  name                     = "cmstgacct"
  resource_group_name      = "{YOUR RESOURCE GROUP NAME}"
  location                 = "{YOUR RESOURCE GROUP LOCATION}"
  account_tier             = "Standard"
  account_replication_type = "LRS"
}
```

## Task 2 - Create a resource group

You can create a resource group in the portal or via command line commands with the azure CLI. If you are struggling with the CLI, just pivot and go create a resource group in the portal (or switch to run the commands in the Azure Cloud Shell rather than from your local machine).

Assuming that creating a resource group is straight forward in the portal, let's do it via the CLI.

### Step 1 - Get Logged in

Run the following command to log in to your Azure subscription:

```text  
az login
```

!["Logging into Azure"](images/Part1-terraform/azurelogin.png)  

A browser window will open, enter login credentials or select an account that you are already logged in to.

!["Selecting an account in the browser"](images/Part1-terraform/azureloginselect.png)  

A confirmation window will appear.

!["Login confirmation"](images/Part1-terraform/azureloginconfirmation.png)  

>**Note:** If you are using the Azure Cloud Shell, you can skip to step 3 and just use the cloud shell.

### Step 2 - Ensure your subscription

Run the following command:

```text  
az account show
```

If the account shown is not the one you want, run the following command to see all the Azure accounts you have access to:

```text  
az account list
```

Copy the value in the `id` field and run the following command:

```text  
az account set --subscription {YOUR_ID}
```

Run the `az account show` command again to confirm that the right account is set.

### Completion Check

You are logged in to Azure with the appropriate subscription.

## Task 3 - Run the deployment

As mentioned in part 1, there are 3 commands that make up the basic Terraform workflow:

- terraform init
- terraform plan
- terraform apply

The first command only needs to be executed when creating a new configuration or updating an existing one. Running multiple times should not cause any issues.

### Step 1 - Issue commands to run the deployment

Before you execute any commands, make sure that you are in the `terraform`folder

!["Terraform directory."](images/Part1-terraform/terraformdirectory.png)

Execute the `terraform init` command, after the command completes you should see the following:

!["Terraform init results."](images/Part1-terraform/terraforminitresult.png)

Next, execute the `terraform plan` command:

```text  
terraform plan -out main.tfplan
```

You should see the following output (some details are omitted):

!["Terraform init results."](images/Part1-terraform/terraformplanresult1.png)

!["Terraform init results."](images/Part1-terraform/terraformplanresult2.png)

Finally, apply the plan by executing the following command:

```text  
terraform apply main.tfplan
```

This is the result:

!["Terraform apply results."](images/Part1-terraform/terraformapplyresult.png)

### Step 2 - Verify the deployment

### Completion Check

You have a storage account in your resource group that was named as you intended.

## Task 4 - Create providers file

As mentioned in part 1, when working with Terraform it is recommended to create separate files to keep everything organized. We will start by creating a separate `providers.tf` file. 

### Step 1 - Create `providers.tf`file

### Step 2 - Move `terraform` and `providers` blocks to providers.tf file

You will now move the `terraform` and `providers` block from the main.tf to the providers.tf file, this should have no impact on your deployment but just to confirm execute the `terraform plan` command, you should see the following messages:

```text
No changes. Your infrastructure matches the configuration.

Terraform has compared your real infrastructure against your configuration and found no differences, so no changes are needed.
```

## Task 5 - Use input variables

In Terraform module parameters are referred to as `input variables` or simply `variables`, in this part of the workshop you'll create input variables for the storage account name and location.  You'll also learn how to use the variables in your deployment.

### Step 1 - Add input variables to the terraform file

For starters, we will only add input variables for the resource group name, storage account name and location of the storage account.

1. Add the following code to the top of the main.tf file:

```text
variable "resourceGroupName" {
    type = string
    nullable = false
    default = "{YOUR RESOURCE GROUP NAME}"
}

variable "storageAccountName" {
    type = string
    nullable = false
    default = "{YOUR STORAGE ACCOUNT NAME}"
}

variable "location" {
    type = string
    nullable = false
    default = "{YOUR RESOURCE GROUP LOCATION}"
}
```

2. Next, use the variables to populate the storage account values, in Terraform input values are referenced using the `var` object. Your storage account resource block should now look like this:

```text
resource "azurerm_storage_account" "cm_stg_acct" {
  name                     = var.storageAccountName
  resource_group_name      = var.resourceGroupName
  location                 = var.location
  account_tier             = "Standard"
  account_replication_type = "LRS"
}
```
3. Execute the `terraform plan` command again, since there were no infrastructure changes you should see this message again:

```text
No changes. Your infrastructure matches the configuration.

Terraform has compared your real infrastructure against your configuration and found no differences, so no changes are needed.
```

### Step 2 - Create a variables file

In the previous step we added the ability to use input variables (or parameters) in the terraform template, in this step we will continue with the best practices mentioned above and we will move those variable definitions to a separate file.

1. Add a variables.tf file to your working directory, please note that this is just a suggested name and that as long as the file is in the same directory Terraform will automatically make those variables available in the main module.

2. Move the variable declarations from the main.tf to the variables.tf file, after the change, the only thing left in the main.tf file should be your resource block.

### Step 3 - Deploy via variables file

Execute the `terraform plan` command again, since we are not updating the infrastructure you should again see no changes in the plan.

### Completion Check

You have a file that you can reuse in multiple resource groups with various storage account names (you would need to change the name in the parameter file at this point to ensure it is unique).

## Task 6 - Use variables and functions

In this module you will learn to use variables and functions to create a unique string name for the storage account name

### Step 1 - Create a variable for the storage account name

### Step 2 - Use the variable in the storage account name

### Step 3 - Add a unique string to the storage account name

### Step 4 - Deploy via parameters file

### Completion Check

You can now deploy the same file to different resource groups multiple times and it will create a unique storage account name per group

## Task 6 - Use modules and outputs

In part 2, we will be doing an entire subscription deployment.  For that reason, let's learn about it quickly here before diving deeper in part 2.

### Step 1 - Create an orchestrator file

Use subscription level

### Step 2 - Create a module for the storage account

call the storage deployment at the subscription scope for the correct resource group

### Step 3 - Create an output for the storage account 

Examine the output of the deployment in the portal

### Step 4 - Show how to leverage an output in another deployment

Add another file to create a container in the storage account
Deploy via a module
Explain that this could easily be done in one file.  The reason for doing it this way is to show how to use outputs in other deployments.

### Step 4 - Deploy via cli

Deploy the subscription level deployment to Azure

## Conclusion

- creating terraform files
- running deployments from the command line
- using parameters
- using variables
- using functions
- using modules
- using outputs
